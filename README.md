# CHECKPOINT II *(due February 23 <sup>rd</sup>)*
> Use a **GITPULL** to get the latest assignments and documentation.

## COMP 2659 - Checkpoint 2 Task List
### Checkpoint 2 Summary
[ ] Asset Creation: Make models in monochrome and 640x400; create sprites in 8, 16, and 32-bit bitmaps.

[ ] Raster Library Testing: Test your raster graphics library (plotting routines).

Note: Animation is not required until Checkpoint 3.

[ ] Data Structures: Write structs for models (e.g., player, walls, NPCs).

[ ] Each must be in its own .h and .c file of the same name.

[ ] Constraint: Avoid decimals/floats; aim for integers only.

[ ] Events Module: Write functions for asynchronous, synchronous, and condition-based events.

[ ] Validation: Use printf to verify that model implementation and event handling are working.

[ ] Documentation: Use the testing guide for test modules (available on D2L).

### Raster Graphics Library
These routines can optionally be done in C first, then in Assembly.

[ ] clear_screen

[ ] clear_region

[ ] plot_pixel

[ ] plot_horizontal_line

[ ] plot_vertical_line

[ ] plot_line (generic line between any two points)

[ ] plot_rectangle

[ ] plot_square

[ ] plot_triangle

[ ] plot_bitmap_8

[ ] plot_bitmap_16

[ ] plot_bitmap_32

[ ] plot_character

[ ] plot_string

### Renderer
[ ] Rendering Library: Develop a library that uses the raster graphics library to render the model's current state to the screen.

Requirement: Must be able to render at least a single frame.

[ ] Object Functions: Each object needs its own render_* function.

[ ] Master Function: Implement a Master_render function.

### Coding Standards & "Other"
[ ] Function Length: Keep functions between 25-30 lines.

[ ] Formatting: Ensure code is readable and properly indented.

[ ] Header Documentation: Each function must include a header describing:

Its purpose from the caller's perspective.

The purpose of each input parameter.

The purpose of each output parameter and return value.

Any assumptions, limitations, or known bugs.

[ ] Source File Metadata: In .c files, write the purpose of data structures and functions.

[ ] Authorship: Include team member names and author(s) in the files.
